00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:10.920
For this video I thought I would just talk about 
something I've been super interested in lately. I  

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:22.480
have been listening to this musical a lot called 
epic the musical. This musical, it doesn't have  

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:34.280
any, like, stage performances yet it's just like a 
concept album. But basically it follows the story  

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:46.560
of The Odyssey it follows Odysseus starting with 
like the end of the Trojan War and then leaving,  

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:59.480
going to the island with the Cyclops and then you 
know leaving going to Aeolus's Sky Island getting  

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:08.480
the wind bag so they can make it home. But then 
his some of his crew sort of betray him and open  

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:22.360
the bag and so Poseidon gets revenge on them for 
disabling his son - one of the Cyclopes - and so  

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:33.320
he only has 40 men left cause Poseidon killed the 
rest of them and so then they go to Circe's Island  

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:44.440
and they get turned into pigs and then they go 
to the underworld and then they meet the sirens  

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:53.640
and deal with them and go through the layer of 
Scylla um and then Odysseus's crew betrays him  

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.920
and then they all end up dying except for 
Odysseus because he did not harm Helios's  

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:14.520
Immortal cattle um yeah and then Odysseus ends 
up on Calypso's Island for 10 years and finally  

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:29.000
he's able to leave and get back to his home 
Ithaca, take his take his throne back, and yeah.
